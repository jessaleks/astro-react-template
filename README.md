# Astro + React Counter Demo


This is an incredibly small demo of using React in an Astro project, with a prop passed in.
As a bonus, I am using a Svelte component out of the box in the same app, just underneath a React component.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run start` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
